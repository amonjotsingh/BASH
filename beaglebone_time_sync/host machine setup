##  ON HOST MACHINE SIDE

#The solution for this problem for us is to connect the board to the network via the medium we are using that is a USB cable. In order to do that we have to 
#STEP 1:
#Configure host machine to forward packets
#Finding the interface of the host machineâ€™s Wireless network and USB Ethernet interface. 
#this command will enable the forwarding on the machine side
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1

#These commands will flush the old rules and firewall so that nothing blocks us from forwarding data
 sudo iptables -t nat -F
 sudo iptables -t mangle -F
 sudo iptables -F
 sudo iptables -X

#this command will enable forwarding data from our ethernet port
iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface enp0s20f0u2 -j MASQUERADE

#this command will forward data to port where beaglebone is connected
iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface enxe415f6f84a17 -j ACCEPT
