As there is no battery backup inside the Beaglebone Black board,
it is not able to retain real time clock. So, whenever we 
connect Beaglebone to our machine and type $date command itâ€™ll show
the last time it was synced with real time clock or the time it was manually set to unless it is connected to network 
,then it obtain the real time from the network we are using
