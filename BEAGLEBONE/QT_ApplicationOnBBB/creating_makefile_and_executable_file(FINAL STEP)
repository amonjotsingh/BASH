In this step we will use qmake command followed by .pro file that will generate Makefile after the execution of command

debian@beaglebone:~/qtproject$ qmake qtproject.pro


To create a executable file
In this we will make a executable file using make command and we can check using ls command that we have and executable file

debian@beaglebone:~/qtproject$ make


debian@beaglebone:~/qtproject$ ls
example.cpp  example.o  Makefile  qtproject  qtproject.pro


STEP 7 : Running executable file
Finally we will run the executable file

debian@beaglebone:~/qtproject$ ./qtproject
