First we need to go to directory $ cd exploringBB/chp14/v4l2 and afterwards we need to use the command

~$ gcc -O2 -Wall `pkg-config --cflags --libs libv4l2` grabber.c -o grabber

that will create a grabber executable file

after running ./grabber you should be able to see a number of .ppm files

and to combine those .ppm files in a video you need to use this command ~$ ./capture -d /dev/video0 -F -o -c 100 > output.raw
