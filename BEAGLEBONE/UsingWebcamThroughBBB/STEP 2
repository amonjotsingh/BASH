V4L2 tools :
To install the V4L2 tool we need to use the command ~$ sudo apt install libv4l-dev
Using this command we will be able to list all the available devices 
~$ v4l2-ctl --all -d 0 

Using ~$ v4l2-ctl --all -d 0 we can get details of the drivers 
Using ~$ v4l2-ctl --set-fmt-video=width=1920,height=1080,pixelformat=1 -d 0 will make us able to set dimensions of the frame
